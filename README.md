# React-Portfolio
This is a react webpage designed to showcase a full-stack developer's portfolio.

## Description
This single page app is designed to dynamically show a full-stack developer's portfolio in order to better showcase their skills. When a potential employer or fellow developer visits this app they can see a live action example of the skills of the portfolio's maker. There is a contact page that will be functional when the developer adopts the skills to merge them into the live codebase.
Using react demonstrates the fullstack skill set that the developer has accumulated over the course of their study.
